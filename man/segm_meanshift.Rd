\arguments{
\item{image}{path or \code{SpatRaster}}

\item{otb}{output of link2GI::linkOTB()}

\item{spatialr}{integer. Spatial radius of the neighborhood}

\item{ranger}{range radius defining the radius (expressed in radiometry unit)
in the multispectral space}

\item{thresh}{algorithm iterative scheme will stop if mean-shift vector is
below this threshold or if iteration number reached maximum number of iterations}

\item{maxiter}{integer. Algorithm iterative scheme will stop if convergence hasnâ€™t been
reached after the maximum number of iterations}

\item{minsize}{integer. Minimum size of a region (in pixel unit) in segmentation. Smaller
clusters will be merged to the neighboring cluster with the closest radiometry.
If set to 0 no pruning is done}

\item{mode}{processing mode, either 'vector' or 'raster'. See details}

\item{vector_neighbor}{logical. If FALSE (the default) a 4-neighborhood connectivity
is activated. If TRUE, a 8-neighborhood connectivity is used}

\item{vector_stitch}{logical. If TRUE (the default), scans polygons on each side
of tiles and stitch polygons which connect by more than one pixel}

\item{vector_minsize}{integer. Objects whose size in pixels is below the minimum
object size will be ignored during vectorization}

\item{vector_simplify}{simplify polygons according to a given tolerance (in pixel).
This option allows reducing the size of the output file or database.}

\item{vector_tilesize}{integer. User defined tiles size for tile-based segmentation.
Optimal tile size is selected according to available RAM if NULL}

\item{mask}{an optional raster used for masking the segmentation. Only pixels
whose mask is strictly positive will be segmented}

\details{
Mean-Shift is a region-based segmentation algorithm that groups pixels with
similar characteristics. It's a non-parametric clustering technique that groups
pixels based on spatial proximity and feature similarity (color, intensity). This
method is particularly effective for preserving edges and defailt while simplifying
textures in high-resolution images. Steps:
\enumerate{
\item Initialization: Each pixel is treated as a point in a multi-dimensional space
(combining spatial and color features).
\item Mean Shift Iterations: For each pixel, a search window moves toward the region
with the highest data density (local maxima) by calculating the mean of neighboring
pixels within the window.
\item Convergence: The process repeats until the movement of the window becomes
negligible, indicating convergence.
\item Label Assignment: Pixels that converge to the same mode (local maxima) are
grouped into the same region.
}

The most important parameters are:
\itemize{
\item spatialr: defines the size of the neighborhood
\item ranger: determines similarity in the feature space
\item maxiter: limits the number of iterations for convergence
\item thresh: defines the convergence criterion based on pixel movement
}

The processing mode 'vector' will output a vector file, and process the input
image piecewise. This allows performing segmentation of very large images. IN
contrast, 'raster' mode will output a labeled raster, and it cannot handle
large data. If mode is 'raster', all the 'vector_*' arguments are ignored.
